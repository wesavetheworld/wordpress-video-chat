========

Tinychat full screen for BuddyPress/WordPress

Simply use shortcode [tinychat_page] and you may need to remove footer as some will show in front of the chat screen.
This also uses my modified Tinychat embed file so Div ID will be ruddernation and the application ID will be Ruddernation, 
If you want to use Tinychats original then you'll have to change the embed file url to: <script src="http://tinychat.com/embed/chat.js"></script>
